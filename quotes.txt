You can win this! Just don't use fire on it!|*chuckle* I almost got killed by those monsters. Compared to that exams are nothing.|Oh Senpai! You came at just the right time!|*squeal* Senpai! That was so cool!|Oh Senpai. If you're free let's go play!|Kanji that was great! You're the man!|Huh? Senpai? Fancy meeting you here!|Yukiko-senpai beats the enemy in style!|You see the same faces every day rumors spread fast and there are times when it gets on my last nerve...|It's weak to ice! This'll be easy!|We need to hurry on!|Uh... why those glasses? Can you see better with them or something?|Oh I see. I chose acetic acid... Duh of course it couldn't have been vinegar.|Now that's a strike!|You... me... even Risette... They were all born from me. All of them are... me.|One enemy to go! Keep it up!|Enemy down! That's the way Yosuke-senpai!|I already settled everything with the agency...!|There's one enemy! You get a free hit!|Two enemies ambushed you! Hold on!|I was alone the entire time... But I didn't have a problem with that. No one expected anything of me.|Enemy down! Go to town Naoto-kun!|There are five enemies! Don't let 'em get you.|Three of 'em! Don't give up now okay?|You okay there Kanji? Don't strain yourself!|Meeting all of you laughing together... Watching the store reading comics playing with the cat...|Ooh a rare one! Don't let it get away!|That's great Senpai! You really get me going!|Y-Yosuke-senpai was... cool!? No way!|W-Wow... I didn't realize you were so cool Senpai.|Two enemies on the field! Crush 'em!|Even though it stands out because it's not like any other food it can be mixed in with any recipe or flavor...|Why are you in swimming trunks? Do you REALLY want to be in those right now?|Well if that's what you want...|Three enemies defeated! You're so cool Senpai.|There are too many people who hold grudges against you for no reason even if you've never met them before.|...Don't apologize so much. You're funny.|Hey it's weak to fire! That's hot!|I feel like I've been able to relax after coming to Inaba.|Oh yeah I should ride with you and... Wait nevermind. You're not supposed to ride double on a scooter.|One enemy! Take your free hit!|This time I'm going to change into a Rise that everyone can like! Keep an eye out for her Senpai!|Woah Kanji! That was great!|Geez if we don't get it together this summer is sunk.|This one's strong. Watch yourselves!|It's weakness is ice! Cool!|Make sure you take notice when I wear it okay?|I'm okay... I should be able to take that bear's place! It's my turn to save you all!|Haha it's so puny! Use electricity on it!|It's so great that I came to this town and met you.|I'm his daughter's age so he treated me like one of the family...|The enemy's weakness is darkness! It's doomed!|Chie-senpai's been hit! Hang in there!|Hey Senpai? Now that I'm getting the hang of school I want to go out more and see the sights.|Enemy defeated! Go for broke Teddie!|If you ever have some time to kill think of me okay?|What...? I have a bad feeling about this...|This guy came to our shop before... Was he... spying on me...? Oh my God... I really was being targeted...|It's weak to wind! This'll be a breeze!|There are two enemies! Go for a free hit!|I'm tired of diets! Enough with going to the gym! Good thing there's something that even I can handle!|...Anyway I'm through with it! I have nothing to do with showbiz and all that stuff now!|Enemy shadows! Take care!|It's showtime! Are you ready?|Oof! That looked like it hurt...!|What!? Glasses with the summer uniform!? It looks even more mismatched...|I felt I could forget Risette and find myself that way...|Looking at these gym clothes makes me think of some of the old variety shows I watched when I was younger.|*giggle* Sorry... I'm not laughing at you. It's just... I thought it would take me a while to make any friends at my new school.|We don't have to rush. But I want to find him quick. Let's give it everything we got Senpai!|Enemy defeated! You're off to a good start!|Awww you're a meanie!|Oh but Grandma doesn't ask me anything. Y'know like why I quit or what I'm thinking of doing next...|Huh!? No way... What's this all about?|What could you possibly know about us? You're the one who's playing a game here.|Really...? Then you might even better a better actor than me.|Enemy down! That's the spirit Teddie!|Go! Beat 'em up!|Noooo probleeeem! It'll be over in a flash.|Places everyone. And... action!|There are two enemies! Careful now!|It's a strong one! Don't lower your guard!|We got one as a gift at the office that's just sitting around. I bet I could borrow it if I asked!|And sometimes I feel like I might be better off if I was in a big city full of strangers... But even then I love that town.|Hey that was a pretty good hit!|You're with me right now because I'm Risette yeah?|I'm no longer a personality! My private time doesn't belong to a manager anymore!|I wasn't expecting that from you Kanji! Sweet!|Sorry I didn't mean to be a downer! There's no point in wondering what might have been.|Plus I have power that can help everyone... I love that!|All I was thinking about was you.|Oh uh I just remembered. There was a question on the exam that I didn't get.|I'd be scared if you could. Some people are just like that though...|Three more on the enemy side! Keep it up!|Hey I'm a good cook too. I'll make something for you Senpai.|Let's keep at it Senpai!|The way she explained it... Tofu looks weak and fragile but it's actually pretty resilient.|That one's totally weak! You better not lose.|I'm sorry... I've practically lost touch with what the normal me is like.|Even if you can I don't want you wearing them... I start laughing and can't concentrate on supporting the others...|I can help you in that world right? With my power... So wouldn't it be better if I joined the team?|I wish I could spend more time with you but... I'll save it for next time.|Be careful.|Here you go three ganmo. That'll be 600 yen. There's extra tofu in there for everyone... A little thank-you for worrying about me.|Three enemies on the field! Be careful!|Hey you had that question too didn't you Kanji?|Yosuke-senpai's scared!|I-I really appreciate what you did for me...|I knew it! Nanako-chan's the most mature person in this room!|I'm sorry... You must've been in a lot of pain up to now. You're part of me but I kept refusing to admit you existed...|Hey you guys have motorcycles!? Lucky you!|Goooood evening everyone! I'm Risette! Thanks for being such faithful viewers!|But they weren't suddenly interested in Rise Kujikawa... They wanted to hang out with Risette.|It's weak to electricity! This'll be easy!|Once we beat him this case is as good as closed!|He came up to me while I was busy working and asked Don't the biker gangs bother you?|...That thing that was on last night? The Midnight Channel yeah?|Hey it ran away! The nerve of that thing!|Phew... you're up! Ok time for a counter-attack!|But none of that matters now! I'm done being Risette! Now I have people who know the real me.|Go Senpai! You rock!|It's Risette! Nice to meet you!|I... I-I've decided to marry this man once we graduate high school!|Wow... Are you good at cooking Senpai?|No! Kanji's scared!|Two enemies down! Keep going Senpai!|I would just listen to the sound of the river the sound of the birds the sound of the rain...|Shouldn't someone help Yukiko-senpai...?|In my heart I've always thought... This isn't the real me... Funny huh? I was the one who wanted to change and...|When I first got to town I used to sit here and do nothing...|Kanji defeated two enemies! Go team!|That was amazing Yukiko-senpai. I'll use those graceful dance-like moves as reference!|That's the way Senpai! Do some more damage!|But I see... You've been through a lot too...|Amazing Yukiko-senpai! Two defeated so far!|Alright we won! We did it!|Light will work on it! This should be a snap!|Ooooh Senpai! That was perfect!|Gee Kanji. They invited us over... At least show some manners.|He seemed to be the type who just keeps talking whether you like it or not... if that makes sense.|You okay Yosuke-senpai? You look hurt.|Hey are those your work clothes? I can't imagine working at a hospital... That's way too scary for me...|It's... it's going to attack! Get ready!|And then... the application my relative sent without telling me passed the first audition.|Enemy down! Show 'em what you've got Kanji!|Senpai... I'm not a nuisance to you am I?|You're there Grandma's there... And above all there's something I can do there.|I'll show you guys around!|You can win this! Just don't use darkness!|Huh? Why? I thought you liked action movies Chie-senpai.|Ugh... They're totally missing the point of a class trip.|Three enemies! We have the initiative!|It's weak to light! Beat it and move on!|Senpai welcome back! Did you find anything?|Aww but I'll win hands-down. You sure you want to make it that easy?|I wasn't interested in being an idol but... I wanted the chance to change myself. And just by chance I won.|Ch-Chie-senpai! Quick someone heal her!|Haha... When it happened I panicked thinking maybe I should turn their offer down.|It's showtime!|Enemy down! Great work Yukiko-senpai!|Light will work on it. This should be a snap!|I'd hate to leave it with him like that... I said some harsh things...|Teddie's acting weird! You should help him!|Kanji's acting weird! Can someone help him?|I never thought I'd be out in public like this.|Senpai have you ever thought that you're pushing yourself too far or that you were just acting...?|Senpai did you see that?|The last time I ate out was at a festival when I was still a little kid. Back then it was me and my family... it was fun.|Just what I'd expect Chie-senpai! Whoo!|Isn't it hard to fight with those on? Not for you Senpai but for everyone else...|Two enemies down! Great Yukiko-senpai!|Go Chie-senpai go! Kick their ass!|*gasp* It got back up! Defeat it fast!|Teddieeee! Heeeey!|Thank you soooo much! I love you guys!|Yes! We won! Congrats guys.|There are three enemies! Don't get cocky!|I was actually bullied at school before I made my debut... I wasn't good at talking and always looked at my feet...|No don't get scared! I'm with you!|I'm gonna show you...what an idol can do!|You need to watch your health Senpai!|You really hit it hard!|I can sense strong power from it... It's awesome Teddie...|Tofu is incredible. I'm nothing like that...|It's BEARY weak to electricity! *giggle*|Thank you... very much. It's because of you and the others than I'm still alive... Heehee...|Th-this isn't good... I feel like I'm going to depend on you even more...|Why don't I start by asking what kind of girl you like?|Then I thought... If I appeared on TV I could make friends... That was literally the only reason I went through with it...|And you seem like the type of guy who knows all the cool spots in town.|You hit it's weakness Yosuke-senpai!|Wow kinda harsh aren't you? I heard you got a nosebleed when you were around our senpai.|Wow it's puny! This'll be cake.|When I got back to school after my debut no one bullied me... I was happy at first with people I didn't even know talking to me...|Two enemies left! Don't lower your guard now!|Cool there's an enemy weak to ice!|You hit the enemy's weakness!|Four enemies left! Don't give up!|Physical attacks won't work! What a pain!|Not good. There's not enough information to go on. But at least we're positive that someone's in there...|I'm all right... I'm more worried about Teddie...|I'll be going to Yasogami High starting tomorrow. But I don't have any friends yet so don't ignore me alright?|Well you shouldn't feel too bad. You have such a nice figure Yukiko-senpai. You could be an idol.|Senpai... Would you be struggling without my help?|It's all right... Get ready everyone.|She just talks about tofu. She says... I'm like tofu. I had to ask her what that meant.|Enemy defeated! Keep up the good work Kanji!|Light won't work. Plan B anyone?|I believe so but it seems like there's more... I felt some powerful presence intervene...|Oh yeah. Want some tofu to take home?|The beach huh...? I've gone before for pinup shoots but it's been a while since I went for fun!|...J-Just kidding!|...Hmm? Weird... There's a dead end up ahead... I thought this was the right way...|Are you all here to check up on me?|Yeah I remember being at my house... When I came to though I was already in the other world.|I was tired yesterday but I couldn't sleep. And it was raining so I decided to try that rumor I'd heard about...|Hey why don't we get our licenses too? It's just a written test right?|Hey you wanna talk a while?|They've weakened Yukiko-senpai!|...It's the same with you isn't it? You don't have to deny it... I won't be mad.|Last one! Go for it!|It's weak to fire! Hehe this'll be easy!|This one's a gimme it's weak to fire!|It's true what they say... It takes all types to make a world.|Now it's my turn to help you guys out Senpai! Don't worry just leave it to me!|Exams huh...? It's been a while since I had to worry about those. Well I'll be okay right?|Thanks! Don't worry I'll make sure to bring along my best swimsuit!|Inoue-san is that you!?|Electricity's busted... but don't give up!|Four of them! You need to thin 'em out!|Guys Chie-senpai's really hurt!|A game...? Aren't you the one who thinks of this as a game?|After a while... I realized something. The person everyone likes the one they say hi to on the street? That's not the real me.|Don't let me down Senpai! Show me your skills!|Thanks Senpai. Now I'm part of the team too!|Now c'mon let's go pester Teddie.|I've made up my mind. I'm gonna get my license!|Just two left! C'mon this fight's not over!|Ah it's a no brainer! I'm sure you'll win!|I know! Let's go do something together. A day's rest is enough to help you feel better!|Does this mean the game's starting!? Urgh this kinda pisses me off! Let's go Senpai!|Aaahhh! It's a butler outfit! You're a great looking butler!|No more encores...|They have a lot of shows like that where they test your courage by putting you in a hospital... Those shows weren't exactly my favorite...|Ohh but sitting behind Senpai sounds great too. I wanna squeeze in close!|I have to protect the smiles of the people who are precious to me.|Yukiko-senpai!? Boy if looks could kill...!|Hey the enemy's weak to fire! That's hot.|Yukiko-senpai? You don't look so good...|Let's do our best!|I won't make the same mistake. There's no such thing as a me who isn't me so I won't run away I wont try to be someone I'm not.|Yukiko-senpai needs help!|You'd be perfect as a butler. You're very dignified and you hardly ever talk. Seriously it totally suits you!|I love Inaba Senpai...|Woah Chie-senpai! That's two defeated!|Darkness won't work so use something else!|Wind will work on it. Go to town guys!|Four enemies! They're wiiiide open!|Welcome back! Did the exploration go well?|Beat it to a pulp! Keep going guys!|Hey that's mean! You make it sound like we're annoying.|A direct hit to its weakness! Go Kanji!|Eek Yosuke-senpai! Someone heal him!|What do I need to know English for!? I can always ask a translator!|Do you go to Yasogami like Senpai? I'll be starting school there tomorrow so I hope we get along too.|Risette is the one everyone likes... The fictional character they sold to the public.|We'll do our best tomorrow after we're recharged today. How does that sound?|Weird...? Like stalkers? Are you guys fans of mine?|The bullying stopped but... I felt like none of them saw the real me.|You're on a roll Senpai! Two defeated!|Let's talk about something fun. After all I don't want to waste the time we have together!|Aww sorry Kanji! But my birthday was last month so I'm sixteen now.|*chuckle* I'm glad you're the first people I got to know here.|I'm a pretty quick study so I'll be fine but I wonder if those two will be okay...|...When I was at my parents' house I was on my best behavior around them...|Let's go Senpai!|Hey who are you looking forward to seeing in a swimsuit Senpai?|But I tend to get recognized everywhere I go so I'm a little nervous about going out on my own...|S-Senpai umm... I'm sorry... Lying about marrying you and all...|I usually treat those people politely so they don't get offended but I was so tired that I kinda ignored him.|Oh that's not good... Darkness won't work!|Go home. If you don't I'll call the police.|Oh I found you Senpai! Oh Marie-chan's with you?|My sense of rhythm combined with the courage it takes to go onstage...Haha I guess my idol experience counts for something huh?|She just talks about tofu. She says... I'm like tofu.|No my health isn't an issue---|Seconded!|When we were filming a lot of times I came here instead of eating boxed lunches.|I would just listen to the sounds of the river the sounds of the birds the sounds of the rain...|Is this really what you want to be talking about with girls around?|I did it!|And I'll only do it if you all get on stage with me.|I was discarding my clothes more than I was discarding my fear...|Did i ever tell you about the time I went on tour with Kanami? She woke me up daily by blasting music right next to my ear...|It's so big we could be in here together! ...Just kidding.|Huh...? You're not hungry?|And during all that I want to have a serious relationship with the man I love and get married on a tropical island!|Geez Senpai you're a natural-born playboy sometimes.|Um... This area is called Shirakawa Boulevard and it's--|Ahh This flavor never changes.|I don't know how... but... I lost everything...|Just leave it to me!|If you think I'm just an idol you're in for trouble. I haven't trained for nothing!|I wasn't interested in being an idol but... I wanted the chance to change myself.|In the future I'd like to be with you and we'll...|I did tons of shoots there. It's just beyond the Moonlight Bridge yeah?|Sure go right ahead. My profile's been public knowledge for ages.|Senpai have you ever thought that you were pushing yourself too far or that you were just acting...?|Grrr... If only I could detect people in the real world...|Alright that was good! I'll keep it up next time!|Yay I win! If you want a rematch talk to my agent!|Oh but my bust size is 2cm smaller than they print. My agency insisted.|Why're you buying another idol's photo?! Mine's in there too!|Secret savings. For a guy. Right. Let's just leave him be...|In my heart I've always thought... This isn't the real me...|But I bet we'll run into the others at the festival. Yosuke-senpai would never pass up something like this.|You're with me now because I'm Risette yeah?|Gosh I'm trying to remember the last time I went to Port Island and I wasn't working... *Chuckle* This'll be great!|Risette? Who the hell is she? There's no such person in this world! I'm no one but myself! C'mon look at me!|When I'm working I have to wear fall clothes during the summer so I don't get a sense of the season's changing.|I was alone the entire time...|Things to mull over?|I wasn't interested in being an idol but... I wanted the chance to change myself.|I was actually bullied at school before I made my debut...|Hey where's Teddie?|Rise and Kanami! Teaming up would be kind of unfair huh?|Score one for the dream team! This dance might go down in history!|xoxoxo SENPAI xoxoxou kno what day it is!keep ur afternoon open!|Personally I think Nanako would be a great asset to my band with her amazing recorder skills.|I don't care if you're a special investigator or an amateur sleuth... All you're doing is solving mysteries.|It kinda sucks but maybe we should get together with everyone this time! Well I'll see you tonight Senpai.|If you're up front it'll look like a metal band.|Umm Senpai… I know you can do it! Show me one last time that you’re the coolest guy in the world!|And now the moment you’ve been waiting for! It’s time for me to show you every last inch of myself!|I longed to be an idol ever since I was a kid. Every day’s so much fun!|Show what huh? Hmhmhm… E-very-thing!|Good evening! It’s me Rise Kujikawa!|Well if a thing is worth doing it’s worth doing all the way! I’m gonna bare it all for you!|I’m gonna show it all off! Let my naked truth be burned into your brains!|Today you’re gonna see every last inch of me!|They’re all watching! All eyes are on me now!|I actually don’t really like handsome-looking guys. I mean it’s what’s on the inside that really counts right?|It’s my first time… Please be gentle.|Why don’t I tell all you fans a little about myself?|Heehee! And for our guests in the front row… I’ll give you extra-special extra-intense service!|This time it’s my turn to save everyone… Don’t worry just leave it to me!|Why don’t I start by asking what kind of girl you like?|Let’s talk about something fun. After all I don’t want to waste the time we have together!|Senpai have you ever thought that you’re pushing yourself too far or that you were just acting…?|Senpai… Please stand up just one more time. We’ll be your strength…|A girl has to save her best outfits for the moments that count the most.|What do you dream about Senpai?|Aaaahhhh! Senpai! You’re here you’re here! Did you miss me?|I’m glad I came to this town. After all… it’s where I met you.|Senpai are you… happy right now? Do you like being with me… like this the way we are now?|I’m turning on the lights okay?|But still I’m a little embarrassed… So I’m gonna turn out the lights!|Hello all you fans out there! Thanks for coming today!|I wanna push it… It’s so tempting… But I can’t; I’m an idol… Ah Senpai!? Y-Y-You weren’t listening were you?|Oh Senpai. If you’re free let’s go play!|Thanks Senpai. Now I’m part of the team too!|I heard last time you choked down something so awful that words couldn’t describe it… You poor dears… Who would do such a horrible thing…?|The person everyone likes the one they say “hi” to on the street? That’s not the real me.|I’ll do my best to make you proud Senpai!|It’s true what they say… It takes all types to make a world.|What…? I dealt all that exquisite pain and you’re still not satisfied? What a finicky guest...|Eee how embarrassing! Is this too hot for TV!?|It’s reeeeeaaaaadyyyy! Incoming food! Out of the way Senpai!|Senpai… Would you be struggling without my help?|My grandma’s food is kind of bland. Though tofu is good for you so…|Thank you Senpai… For finding me.|*chuckle* I’m glad you’re the first people I got to know here.|There are too many people who hold grudges against you for no reason even if you’ve never met them before.|All right Risetteers! Don’t touch that dial!|Ahahahahah! C’mon look! You can’t tear your eyes away!|Don’t worry I’ll let you have a taste. Ooh or maybe I could spoon feed you. *chuckle*|Goooood evening everyone! I’m Risette!|Oh Senpai! I just finished my shift at the store. Are you free today?|Whew… I think I’ve used up all my energy. But I think I’m looking pretty good! Were you watching?|Haha! Enjoying yourself? I’ve got a ways to go until I show my true self… You ain’t seen nothin’ yet!|Does everybody know what time it is? Showtime!|What an ill-mannered guest! Maybe you’re looking for an experience that’s a little more intense?!|This spring one young girl levels up to become a high school idol… Yayyyy!|I’m going to learn everything about myself. I’ll become stronger too so I can accept all the bad things about me and not run away.|When we come back you’ll get a good long look at the real me! Maru-Q!
